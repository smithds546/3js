# 3js
practicing some 3js to eventually model an interactive 3D model from blender.
Next steps 22/11/2024:
    watch youtub video on the whole process of downloading model and displaying it on website
    implement orbital controls. https://youtu.be/ylyLefnMc1c?si=8no0DsDvKcKRN3Wh

Next steps 03/12/2024:
    continue through the same YT video, hopefully get the model looking sharper and adding a scene light and a starfield.
